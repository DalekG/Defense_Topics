# Device-ID
Device-ID is a PAN-OS policy construct for enforcement and visibility. It allows administrators to apply consistent policy control and threat prevention to a device no matter where it moves within the network or what its IP address is at any given time. The presence of device identity information in firewall logs provides visibility that enables workflows for threat assessment, incident response, and remediation.

Device-ID provides traceability for devices and the ability to associate network events with specific devices. This allows you to gain context for how events relate to devices and write policies that are associated with devices, instead of users, locations, or IP addresses, which can change over time.

Starting in PAN-OS 10.0, Device-ID allows policies to be created that follow a device no matter the location in the network.
