# App-ID

App-ID enables you to see the application on your network and learn how they work, their behavioral characteristics, and their relative risk. Applications and functions are identified through multiple techniques, to include application signatures, decryption, protocol decoding, and heuristics.

- App-ID organizes by categories, technologies, risk, etc.
- Allows for positve application enfocement model
- Allows for application and application function allow/deny
- Can implement custom applications to be inspected in the same manne a others.

By default, when you allow an application, it will only be allwed on default ports used by that application.

Applipedia is the appliction database that Palo lto Networks uses along with App-ID to identif ppliations traveling through your firewall. The data listed in Applipedia can e used to help you determine what applications to allow though your firewall. Applipedia can also be used toinvetigate aplication characteristics, classification, and dependecies. Appication data includes the name, description, additional informaon, standard ports, and implicity use of applications.
