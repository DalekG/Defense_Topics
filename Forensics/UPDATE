## Notes

Noting artifacts is a good way to help analysts build a solid timeline of events and allows analysts to really peice the puzzle together. Having a notes template, such as using an excel sheet is a good way to start. Using excel will allow for analysts to add atrifact information as they go and later filter on the timeline.
